## My process

### Built with

- React (JavaScript Library)
- React Router
- CSS Modules - For styles
- REST Countries API

### Continued development

I plan to continue building projects using React and learning how to deal with more complex state management using the useReducer/useContext hooks & Redux. Building a larger and more complex project is my next goal. I also want to continue improving at CSS and have started learning Tailwind CSS.
